## Dullboy

#### A low contrast, minimalistic theme for Neovim.

This theme is based on my own preferences. Low contrast and predominantly monochrome, with some subtle / dull colour hints to help navigate the eyes.

It is currently in very early development. There are still a couple of inconsistencies in the applicaton of the colours which need to be ironed out. 

Additionally I plan to make a few changes: 
- I wish to refactor the code in order that users can pass in config options to alter the them to their tastes
- I'm going to add a second variant of the theme with slightly higher contrast
