## Dullboy

#### A low contrast, minimalistic theme for Neovim.

This theme is based on my own preferences. Low contrast and predominantly monochrome, with some subtle / dull colour hints to help navigate the eyes.

It is currently in very early development. There are still some inconsistencies in the applicaton of the colours which need to be ironed out. 

Additionally I plan to make a few changes: 
- I wish to refactor the code in order that users can pass in config options to alter the theme to their tastes
- I'm going to add a second variant of the theme with slightly higher contrast
